## About TinyTrack

The TinyTrack: Digital Baby Wellness and Growth Platform is designed to address the challenges faced by parents in monitoring the early development stages of their children. The purpose of this project is to develop a user-friendly, web-based system that centralizes and simplifies baby wellness management. TinyTrack aims to assist Malaysian parents by integrating automated tools and features into a single platform to support the tracking of baby wellness metrics such as height, weight, medical check-up schedules and developmental milestones. The platform offers parents with timely reminders, parenting tips and educational resources and easy-to-understand data visualizations, empowering parents to take proactive steps in managing their baby's health and development. In addition, this project supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being by promoting early detection of potential health issues through regular tracking of a babyâ€™s growth and development. Therefore, by enabling parents to monitor wellness metrics and receive health-related guidance, TinyTrack aspires to contribute to healthier early childhood outcomes and foster informed parenting practices.
